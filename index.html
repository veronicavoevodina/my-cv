                <p class="text">I'm 27. I finished banking faculty of Polessky state university and civil law of MITSO. I were working as personal manager of VIP clients in a bank. Since 2018 I have been in maternity leave. And today I'd like to try myself in something new. So I have decided to study HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I hope it will be successfully.</p>
